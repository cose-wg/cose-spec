        Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is data format designed for small code size and small message size.
        There is a need for the ability to have the basic security services defined for this data format.
        This document specifies how to do signatures, message authentication codes and encryption using this data format.

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

      <t>
        There has been an increased focus on the small, constrained devices that make up the Internet of Things (IOT). 
        One of the standards that has come of of this process is the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR). 
        CBOR extended the data model of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) by allowing for binary data among other changes. 
        CBOR is being adopted by several of the IETF working groups dealing with the IOT world as their encoding of data structures. 
        CBOR was designed specifically to be both small in terms of messages transport and implementation size as well having a schema free decoder.
        A need exists to provide basic message security services for IOT and using CBOR as the message encoding format makes sense.
      </t>

      <t>
        The JOSE working group produced a set of documents <xref target="RFC7515"/><xref target="RFC7516"/><xref target="RFC7517"/><xref target="RFC7518"/> that defined how to perform encryption, signatures and message authentication (MAC) operations for JSON documents and then to encode the results using the JSON format <xref target="RFC7159"/>.
        This document does the same work for use with the CBOR <xref target="RFC7049"/> document format.
        While there is a strong attempt to keep the flavor of the original JOSE documents, two considerations are taken into account:
      </t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            CBOR has capabilities that are not present in JSON and should be used. 
            One example of this is the fact that CBOR has a method of encoding binary directly without first converting it into a base64 encoded string.
          </t>
          <t>
            COSE is not a direct copy of the JOSE specification.
            In the process of creating COSE, decisions that were made for JOSE were re-examined.
            In many cases different results were decided on as the criteria were not always the same as for JOSE.

        <t>
          There currently is no standard CBOR grammar available for use by specifications.
          We therefore describe the CBOR structures in prose.
          There is a version of a CBOR grammar in the CBOR Data Definition Language (CDDL) <xref target="I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl"/>.
          An informational version of the CBOR grammar that reflects what is in the prose can be found in <xref target="Grammar_Appendix"/>.
          CDDL has not been fixed, so this grammar may will only work with the version of CDDL at the time of publishing.
        </t>

        <t>
          The document was developed by first working on the grammar and then developing the prose to go with it.
          An artifact of this is that the prose was written using the primitive type strings defined by early versions CDDL.
          In this specification the following primitive types are used:
          <list style="none">
            <t>bstr - byte string (major type 2).</t>
            <t>int - an unsigned integer or a negative integer.</t>
            <t>nil - a null value (tag 7.22).</t>
            <t>nint - a negative integer (major type 1).</t>
            <t>tstr - a UTF-8 text string (major type 3).</t>
            <t>uint - an unsigned integer (major type 0).</t>

          NOTE: For the purposes of review, we are currently interlacing the CDLL grammar into the text of document.
          This is being done for simplicity of comparision of the grammar againist the prose.
          The grammar will be removed to an appendix during WGLC.

        <t>
          In JSON, maps are called objects and only have one kind of map key: a string.
          In COSE, we use both strings and integers (both negative and non-negative integers) as map keys, as well as data items to identify specific choices.
          The integers (both positive and negative) are used for compactness of encoding and easy comparison.
          (Generally, in this document the value zero is going to be reserved and not used.)
          Since the work "key" is mainly used in its other meaning, as a cryptographic key, we use the term "label" for this usage of either an integer or a string to identify map keys and choose data items.

          In this document we use the following terminology:

            I have not gone through the document to determine what needs to be here yet.

      <section title="Mandatory to Implement Algorithms">
        <t>
          One of the issues that needs to be addressed is a requirement that a standard specify a set of algorithms that are required to be implemented.
          <cref source="JLS">
            It would be possible to extend this section to talk about those decisions which an application needs to think about rather than just talking about MTI algoithms.
          </cref>
          This is done to promote interoperability as it provides a minimal set of algorithms that all devices can be sure will exist at both ends.
          However, we have elected not to specify a set of mandatory algorithms in this document.
        </t>

        <t>
          It is expected that COSE is going to be used in a wide variety of applications and on a wide variety of devices.
          Many of the constrained devices are going to be setup to used a small fixed set of algorithms, and this set of algorithms may not match those available on a device.
          We therefore have deferred to the application protocols the decision of what to specify for mandatory algorithms.
        </t>

        <t>
          Since the set of algorithms in an environment of constrained devices may depend on what the set of devices are and how long they have been in operation, we want to highlight that application protocols will need to specify some type of discovery method of algorithm capabilities.
          The discovery method may be as simple as requiring preconfiguration of the set of algorithms to providing a discovery method built into the protocol.
          S/MIME provided a number of different ways to approach the problem:

    <section anchor="the-cosemsg-structure" title="The COSE_MSG structure">

      <t>
        The COSE_MSG structure is a top level CBOR object that corresponds to the DataContent type in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="RFC5652"/>.
        <!-- Hannes
             I would remove references to CMS and S/MIME since they are most likely only helpful to a very small audience.

        -->
        <cref source="Hannes">I would remove references to CMS and S/MIME since they are most likely only helpful to a very small audience.</cref>

        This structure allows for a top level message to be sent that could be any of the different security services.
        The security service is identified within the message.
      </t>

      <t>
        The COSE_Tagged_MSG CBOR type takes the COSE_MSG and prepends a CBOR tag of TBD1 to the encoding of COSE_MSG.
        By having both a tagged and untagged version of the COSE_MSG structure, it becomes easy to either use COSE_MSG as a top level object or embedded in another object.
        The tagged version allows for a method of placing the COSE_MSG structure into a choice, using a consistent tag value to determine that this is a COSE object.
      </t>

      <t>
        The existence of the COSE_MSG and COSE_Tagged_MSG CBOR data types are not intended to prevent protocols from using the individual security primitives directly.
        Where only a single service is required, that structure can be used directly.
      </t>

      <t>
        Each of the top-level security objects use a CBOR array as the base structure.
        For each of the top-level security objects, the first field is a 'msg_type'.
        The CBOR type for a 'msg_type' is 'int'.
        The 'msg_type' is defined to distinguish between the different structures when they appear as part of a COSE_MSG object.
        <cref source="JLS">
          I have moved msg_type into the individual structures.
          However, they would not be necessary in the cases where a) the security service is known and b) security libraries can setup to take individual structures.
          Should they be moved back to just appearing if used in a COSE_MSG rather than on the individual structure?
          This would make things shorter if one was using just a signed message because the msg_type field can be omitted as well as the COSE_Tagged_MSG tag field.
          One the other hand, it will complicated the code if one is doing general purpose library type things.
        </cref>
        <cref source="JLS">Should we create an IANA registries for the values of msg_type?</cref>
        <cref source="CB">I would like to make msg_type go away</cref>
      </t>

      <t>
        The message types defined in this document are:
        <list style="none">
          <t>0 - Reserved.</t>
          <t>1 - Signed Message.</t>
          <t>2 - Enveloped Message</t>

          <t>4 - Encrypted Message</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        Implementations MUST be prepared to find an integer in this field that does not correspond to the values 1 to 3.
        If a message type is found then the client does not support the associated security object, the client MUST stop attempting to process the structure and fail.
        The value of 0 is reserved and not assigned to a security object.
        If the value of 0 is found, then clients MUST fail processing the structure.
        Implementations need to recognize that the set of values might be extended at a later date, but they should not provide a security service based on guesses of what the security object might be.

      <t>
        The structure of COSE has been designed to have two buckets of information that are not considered to be part of the payload itself, but are used for holding information about content, algorithms, keys, or evaluation hints for the  processing of the layer.
        These two buckets are available for use in all of the structures in this document except for keys.
        While these buckets can be present, they may not all be usable in all instances.
        For example, while the protected bucket is defined as part of recipient structures, most of the algorithms that are used for recipients do not provide the necessary functionality to provide the needed protection and thus the bucket should not be used.
      </t>

      <t>
        Both buckets are implemented as CBOR maps.
        The map key is a 'label' (<xref target="label"/>).
        The value portion is dependent on the definition for the label.
        Both maps use the same set of label/value pairs. 
        The integer and string values for labels has been divided into several sections with a standard range, a private range, and a range that is dependent on the algorithm selected.
        The defined labels can be found in the 'COSE Header Parameters' IANA registry (<xref target="cose-header-key-table"/>).
      </t>

      <t>
        Two buckets are provided for each layer:

        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText='protected'>
            contains parameters about the current layer that are to be cryptographically protected.
            This bucket MUST be empty if it is not going to be included in a cryptographic computation.
            This bucket is encoded in the message as a binary object.
            This value is obtained by CBOR encoding the protected map and wrapping it in a bstr object.
            Senders SHOULD encode an empty protected map as a zero length binary object (it is shorter).
            Recipients MUST accept both a zero length binary value and a zero length map encoded in the binary value.
            The wrapping allows for the encoding of the protected map to be transported with a greater chance that it will not be altered in transit.
            (Badly behaved intermediates could decode and re-encode, but this will result in a failure to verify unless the re-encoded byte string is identical to the decoded byte string.)
            This finesses the problem of all parties needing to be able to do a common canonical encoding.
          </t>
          
          <t hangText='unprotected'>
            contains parameters about the current layer that are not cryptographically protected.
          </t>
        </list>

        Only parameters that deal with the current layer are to be placed at that layer.
        As an example of this, the parameter 'content type' describes the content of the message being carried in the message.
        As such this parameter is placed only the the content layer and is not placed in the recipient or signature layers.
        In principle, one should be able to process any given layer without reference to any other layer.
        (The only data that should need to cross layers is the cryptographic key.)
      </t>

      <t>
        The buckets are present in all of the security objects defined in this document.
        The fields in order are the 'protected' bucket (as a CBOR 'bstr' type) and then the 'unprotected' bucket (as a CBOR 'map' type).
        The presence of both buckets is required.
        The parameters that go into the buckets come from the IANA "COSE Header Parameters" (<xref target="cose-header-key-table"/>).
        Some common parameters are defined in the next section, but a number of parameters are defined throughout this document.

            <t hangText='alg'>
              This parameter is used to indicate the algorithm used for the security processing.
              This parameter MUST be present at each level of a signed, encrypted or authenticated message.
              The value is taken from the 'COSE Algorithm Registry' (see <xref target="cose-algorithm-registry"/>).
            </t>
            
            <t hangText='crit'>
              This parameter is used to ensure that applications will take appropriate action based on the values found.
              The parameter is used to indicate which protected header labels an application that is processing a message is required to understand.
              The value is an array of COSE Header Labels.
              When present, this parameter MUST be placed in the protected header bucket.

                <t>
                  Integer labels in the range -1 to -255 can be omitted as they are algorithm dependent.
                  If an application can correctly process an algorithm, it can be assumed that it will correctly process all of the parameters associated with that algorithm.
                  (The algorithm range is -1 to -65536, it is assumed that the higher end will deal with more optional algorithm specific items.)

              The header parameter values indicated by 'crit' can be processed by either the security library code or by an application using a security library, the only requirement is that the parameter is processed.
              If the 'crit' value list includes a value for which the parameter is not in the protected bucket, this is a fatal error in processing the message.
            </t>
            
            <t hangText='content type'>
              This parameter is used to indicate the content type of the data in the payload or ciphertext fields.
              Integers are from the 'CoAP Content-Formats' IANA registry table.
              Strings are from the IANA 'Media Types' registry.
              Applications SHOULD provide this parameter if the content structure is potentially ambiguous.
            </t>
            
            <t hangText='kid'>
              This parameter one of the ways that can be used to find the key to be used.
              The value of this parameter is matched against the 'kid' member in a COSE_Key structure.
              Applications MUST NOT assume that 'kid' values are unique.
              There may be more than one key with the same 'kid' value, it may be required that all of the keys need to be checked to find the correct one.
              The internal structure of 'kid' values is not defined and generally cannot be relied on by applications.
              Key identifier values are hints about which key to use, they are not directly a security critical field, for this reason they can be placed in the unprotected headers bucket.
            </t>

            <t hangText='nonce'>
              This parameter holds either a nonce or Initialization Vector value.
              The value can be used either as a counter value for a protocol or as an IV for an algorithm.
            </t>

            <t hangText='counter signature'>
              This parameter holds a counter signature value.
              Counter signatures provide a method of having a second party sign some data, the counter signature can occur as an unprotected attribute in any of the following structures: COSE_Sign, COSE_signature, COSE_enveloped, COSE_recipient, COSE_encryptedData, COSE_mac.
              These structures all have the same basic structure so that a consistent calculation of the counter signature can be computed.
              Details on computing counter signatures are found in <xref target="counter_signature"/>.

            They are really specific to an algorithm and can potentially be defined in different ways for different algorithms.
            As an example, it would make sense to defined nonce for CCM and GCM modes that can have the leading zero bytes stripped, while for other algorithms this might be undesirable.

Other items might be challenge/response fields for freshness as these are likely to be common.

    <section anchor="signing-structure" title="Signing Structure">

      <t>
        The signature structure allows for one or more signatures to be applied to a message payload.
        There are provisions for parameters about the content and parameters about the signature to be carried along with the signature itself.
        These parameters may be authenticated by the signature, or just present.
        Examples of parameters about the content would be the type of content, when the content was created, and who created the content.
        Examples of parameters about the signature would be the algorithm and key used to create the signature, when the signature was created, and counter-signatures.
      </t>

      <t>
        When more than one signature is present, the successful validation of one signature associated with a given signer is usually treated as a successful signature by that signer.
        However, there are some application environments where other rules are needed.
        An application that employs a rule other than one valid signature for each signer must specify those rules.
        Also, where simple matching of the signer identifier is not sufficient to determine whether the signatures were generated by the same signer, the application specification must describe how to determine which signatures were generated by the same signer.
        Support of different communities of recipients is the primary reason that signers choose to include more than one signature.
        For example, the COSE_Sign structure might include signatures generated with the RSA signature algorithm and with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature algorithm.
        This allows recipients to verify the signature associated with one algorithm or the other.

        <t>
          One of the features that we supply in the COSE document is the ability for applications to provide additional data to be authenticated as part of the security, but that is not carried as part of the COSE object.
          The primary reason for supporting this can be seen by looking at the CoAP message struture <xref target="RFC7252"/> where the facility exists for options to be carried before the payload.
          An example of data that can be placed in this location would be transaction ids and nonces to check for replay protection.
          If the data is in the options section, then it is available for routers to help in performing the replay detection and prevention.
          However, it may also be desired to protect these values so that they cannot be modified in transit.
          This is the purpose of the externally supplied data field.
        </t>

        <t>
          This document describes the process for using a byte array of externally supplied authenticated data, however the method of constructing the byte array is a function of the application.
          Applications which use this feature need to define how the externally supplied authenticated data is to be constructed.
          Such a construction needs to take into account the following issues:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              If multiple items are included, care needs to be taken that data cannot bleed between the items.
              This is usually addressed by making fields fixed width and/or encoding the length of the field.
              Using options from CoAP as an example, these fields use a TLV structure so they can be concatenated without any problems.
            </t>
            <t>
              If multiple items are included, a defined order for the items needs to be defined.
              Using options from CoAP as an example, an application could state that the fields are to be ordered by the option number.

      <section anchor="counter_signature" title="Computing Counter Signatures">
        <t>
          Counter signatures provide a method of having a different signature occur on some piece of content.
          This is normally used to provide a signature on a signature allowing for a proof that a signature existed at a given time.
          In this document we allow for counter signatures to exist in a greater number of environments.
          A counter signature can exist, for example, on a COSE_encyptedData object and allow for a signature to be present on the encrypted content of a message.
        </t>

        <t>
          The creation and validation of counter signatures over the different items relies on the fact that the structure all of our objects have the same structure.
          The first element may be a message type, this is followed by a set of protected attributes, a set of unprotected attributes and a body in that order.
          This means that the Sig_structure can be used for in a uniform manner to get the byte stream for processing a signature.
          If the counter signature is going to be computed over a COSE_encryptedData structure, the body_protected and payload items can be mapped into the Sig_structure in the same manner as from the COSE_Sign structure.
        </t>

        <t>
          While one can create a counter signature for a COSE_Sign structure, there is not much of a point to doing so.  It is equivalent to create a new COSE_signature structure and placing it in the signatures array.  It is strongly suggested that it not be done, but it is not banned.

        COSE supports two different encryption structures.
        OOSE_enveloped is used when the key needs to be explicilty identified.
        This structure supports the use of recipient structures to allow for random content encryption keys to be used..
        COSE_encrypted is used when the a recipient structure is not needed because the key to be used is known implicitly.

      <section title="Enveloped COSE structure">

      <t>
        The enveloped structure allows for one or more recipients of a message.
        There are provisions for parameters about the content and parameters about the recipient information to be carried in the message.
        The parameters associated with the content can be authenticated by the content encryption algorithm.
        The parameters associated with the recipient can be authenticated by the recipient algorithm (when the algorithm supports it).
        Examples of parameters about the content are the type of the content, when the content was created, and the content encryption algorithm.
        Examples of parameters about the recipient are the recipients key identifier, the recipient encryption algorithm.

        This document allows for the use of all of the same classes of recipient algorithms as are allowed for encryption.

      <t>
        When using MAC operations, there are two modes in which it can be used. 
        The first is just a check that the content has not been changed since the MAC was computed. 
        Any class of recipient algorithm can be used for this purpose. 
        The second mode is to both check that the content has not been changed since the MAC was computed, and to use recipient algorithm to verify who sent it.
        The classes of recipient algorithms that support this are those that use a pre-shared secret or do static-static key agreement (without the key wrap step).
        In both of these cases the entity MACing the message can be validated by a key binding. 
        (The binding of identity assumes that there are only two parties involved and you did not send the message yourself.)

    <section title="Signature Algorithms">
      <t>
        There are two basic signature algorithm structures that can be used.
        The first is the common signature with appendix.
        In this structure, the message content is processed and a signature is produced, the signature is called the appendix.
        This is the message structure used by our common algorithms such as ECDSA and RSASSA-PSS.
        (In fact the SSA in RSASSA-PSS stands for Signature Scheme with Appendix.)
        The basic structure becomes:
      </t>
      <figure><artwork>
        <![CDATA[
signature = Sign(message content, key)

valid = Verification(message content, key, signature)
]]>
      </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>
        The second is a signature with message recovery.
        (An example of such an algorithm is <xref target="PVSig"/>.)
        In this structure, the message content is processed, but part of is included in the signature.
        Moving bytes of the message content into the signature allows for an effectively smaller signature, the signature size is still potentially large, but the message content is shrunk.
        This has implications for systems implementing these algoritms and for applications that use them.
        The first is that the message content is not fully available until after a signature has been validated.
        Until that point the part of the message contained inside of the signature is unrecoverable.
        The second is that the security analysis of the strength of the signature is very much based on the structure of the message content.
        Messages which are highly predictable require additional randomness to be supplied as part of the signature process, in the worst case it becomes the same as doing a signature with appendix.
        Thirdly, in the event that multple signatures are applied to a message, all of the signature algorithms are going to be required to consume the same number of bytes of message content.
      </t>

      <figure><artwork>
        <![CDATA[
signature, message sent = Sign(message content, key)

valid, message content = Verification(message sent, key, signature)
]]>
      </artwork></figure>

      <t>
        At this time, only signatures with appendixes are defined for use with COSE, however considerable interest has been expressed in using a signature with message recovery algorithm due to the effective size reduction that is possible.
        Implementations will need to keep this in mind for later possible integration.

          ECDSA <xref target="DSS"/> defines a signature algorithm using ECC.
        </t>

        <t>
          The ECDSA signature algorithm is parameterized with a hash function (h).
          In the event that the length of the hash function output is greater than group of the key, the left most bytes of the hash output are used.

        <t>
          This document defines ECDSA to work only with the curves P-256, P-384 and P-521.
          This document requires that the curves be encoded using the 'EC2' key type.
          Implementations need to check that the key type and curve are correct when creating and verifying a signature.
          Other documents can defined it to work with other curves and points in the future.
        </t>

        <t>
          In order to promote interoperability, it is suggested that SHA-256 be used only with curve P-256, SHA-384 be used only with curve P-384 and SHA-512 be used with curve P-521.
          This is aligned with the recommendation in Section 4 of <xref target="RFC5480"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The signature algorithm results in a pair of integers (R, S).
          These integers will be of the same order as length of the key used for the signature process.
          The signature is encoded by converting the integers into byte strings of the same length as the key size.
          The length is rounded up to the nearest byte and is left padded with zero bits to get to the correct length.
          The two integers are then concatenated together to form a byte string that is the resulting signature.
        </t>

        <t>
          Using the function defined in <xref target="RFC3447"/> the signature is:
          <vspace/>
          Signature = I2OSP(R, n) | I2OSP(S, n)
          <vspace/>
          where n = ceiling(key_length / 8)
        </t>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
          <t>
          The security strength of the signature is no greater than the minimum of the security strength associated with the bit length of the key and the security strength of the hash function.
        </t>

        <t>
          System which have poor random number generation can leak their keys by signing two different messages with the same value of 'k'.
          <xref target="RFC6979"/> provides a method to deal with this problem by making 'k' be deterministic based on the message content rather than randomly generated.
          Applications which specify ECDSA should evaluate the ability to get good random number generation and require this when it is not possible.
          Note: Use of this technique a good idea even when good random number generation exists.
          Doing so both reduces the possiblity of having the same value of 'k' in two signature operations, but allows for reproducable signature values which helps testing.
        </t>

        <t>
          There are two substitution that can theoretically be mounted against the ECDSA signature algorithm.
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Changing the curve used to validate the signature:
              If one changes the curve used to validate the signature, then potentially one could have a two messages with the same signature each computed under a different curve.
              The only requirement on the new curve is that it's order be the same as the old one and it be acceptable to the client.
              An example would be to change from using the curve secp256r1 (aka P-256) to using secp256k1.
              (Both are 256 bit curves.)
              We current do not have any way to deal with this version of the attack except to restrict the overall set of curves that can be used.
            </t>

            <t>
              Change the hash function used to validate the signature:
              If one has either two different hash functions of the same length, or one can truncate a hash function down, then one could potentially find collisions between the hash functions rather than within a single hash function.
              (For example, truncating SHA-512 to 256 bits might collide with a SHA-256 bit hash value.)
              This attack can be mitigated by including the signature algorithm identifier in the data to be signed.

            In addition to needing to worry about keys that are too small to provide the required security,  there are issues with keys that are too large.
            Denial of service attacks have been mounted with overly large keys.
            This has the potential to consume resources with potentially bad keys.
            There are two reasonable ways to address this attack.
            First, a key should not be used for a cryptographic operation until it has been matched back to an authorized user.
            This approach means that no cryptography would be done except for authorized users.
            Second, applications can impose maximum as well as minimum length requirements on keys.
            This limits the resources consumed even if the matching is not performed until the cryptography has been done.
          </t>

          <t>
            There is a theoretical hash substitution attack that can be mounted against RSASSA-PSS.
            However, the requirement that the same hash function be used consistently for all operations is an effective mitigation against it.
            Unlike ECDSA, hash functions are not truncated so that the full hash value is always signed.
            The internal padding structure of RSASSA-PSS means that one needs to have multiple collisions between the two hash functions in order to be successful in producing a forgery based on changing the hash function.
            This is highly unlikely.

    <section title="Message Authentication (MAC) Algorithms">
      <t>
        Message Authentication Codes (MACs) provide data authentication and integrity protection.
        They provide either no or very limited data origination.
        (One cannot, for example, be used to prove the identity of the sender to a third party.)
      </t>

      <t>
        MACs are designed in the same basic structure as signature with appendix algorithms.
        The message content is processed and an authentication code is produced, the authentication code is frequently called a tag.
        The basic structure becomes:
      </t>
      <figure><artwork>
        <![CDATA[
tag = MAC_Create(message content, key)

valid = MAC_Verify(message content, key, tag)
]]>
      </artwork></figure>
      

      <t>
        MAC algorithms can be based on either a block cipher algorithm (i.e. AES-MAC) or a hash algorithm (i.e. HMAC).
        This document defines a MAC algorithm for each of these two constructions.
      </t>

      <section title="Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC)">
        <t>
          The Hash-base Message Authentication Code algorithm (HMAC) <xref target="RFC2104"/><xref target="RFC4231"/> was designed to deal with length extension attacks.
          The algorithm was also designed to allow for new hash algorithms to be directly plugged in without changes to the hash function.
          The HMAC design process has been vindicated as, while the security of hash algorithms such as MD5 has decreased over time, the security of HMAC combined with MD5 has not yet been shown to be compromised <xref target="RFC6151"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The HMAC algorithm is parameterized by an inner and outer padding, a hash function (h) and an authentication tag value length.
          For this specification, the inner and outer padding are fixed to the values set in <xref target="RFC2104"/>.
          The length of the authentication tag corresponds to the difficulty of producing a forgery.
          For use in constrained environments, we define a set of HMAC algorithms that are truncated.
          There are currently no known issues when truncating, however the security strength of the message tag is correspondingly reduced in strength.
          When truncating, the left most tag length bits are kept and transmitted.

          Some recipient algorithms carry the key while others derive a key from secret data.
          For those algorithms which carry the key (i.e. RSA-OAEP and AES-KeyWrap), the size of the HMAC key SHOULD be the same size as the underlying hash function.
          For those algorithms which derive the key, the derived key MUST be the same size as the underlying hash function.

            HMAC has proved to be resistant even when used with weakening hash algorithms.
            The current best method appears to be a brute force attack on the key.

    <section title="Content Encryption Algorithms">
      <t>
        Content Encryption Algorithms provide data confidentialty for potentially large blocks of data using a symmetric key.
        They provide either no or very limited data origination.
        (One cannot, for example, be used to prove the identity of the sender to a third party.)
        The ability to provide data origination is linked to how the symmetric key is obtained.
      </t>

      <t>
        We restrict the set of legal content encryption algorithms to those which support authentication both of the content and additional data.
        The encryption process will generate some type of authentication value, but that value may be either explicit or implicit in terms of the algorithm definition.
        For simplicity sake, the authentication code will normally be defined as being appended to the cipher text stream.
        The basic structure becomes:

        <![CDATA[
ciphertext = Encrypt(message content, key, additional data)

valid, message content = Decrypt(cipher text, key, additional data)

      <t>
        Most AEAD algorithms are logically defined as returning the message content only if the decryption is valid.
        Many but not all implementations will follow this convention.

      <section title="AES CCM">
        <t>
          Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) is a generic authentication encryption block cipher mode defined in <xref target="RFC3610"/>.
          The CCM mode is combined with the AES block encryption algorithm to define a commonly used content encryption algorithm used in constrainted devices.
        </t>

        <t>
          The CCM mode has two parameter choices.
          The first choice is M, the size of the authentication field.
          The choice of the value for M involves a trade-off between message expansion and the probably that an attacker can undetecably modify a message.
          
          The second choice is L, the size of the length field.
          This value requires a trade-off between the maximum message size and the size of the Nonce.
        </t>

        <t>
          It is unfortunate that the specification for CCM specified L and M as a count of bytes rather than a count of bits.
          This leads to possible misunderstandings where AES-CCM-8 is frequently used to refer to a version of CCM mode where the size of the authentication is 64-bits and not 8-bits.
          These values have traditionally been specified as bit counts rather than byte counts.
          This document will follow the tradition of using bit counts so that it is easier to compare the different algorithms presented in this document.
        </t>

        <t>
          We define a matrix of algorithms in this document over the values of L and M.
          Constrained devices are usually operating in situations where they use short messages and want to avoid doing recipient specific cryptographic operations.
          This favors smaller values of M and larger values of L.
          Less constrained devices do will want to be able to user larger messages and are more willing to generate new keys for every operation.
          This favors larger values of M and smaller values of L.
          (The use of a large nonce means that random generation of both the key and the nonce will decrease the chances of repeating the pair on two different messages.)
        </t>

        <t>
          The following values are used for L:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="16-bits (2)">
              limits messages to 2^16 bytes (64Kbyte) in length.
              This sufficently long for messages in the constrainted world.
              The nonce length is 13 bytes allowing for 2^(13*8) possible values of the nonce without repeating.
            </t>
            <t hangText="64-bits (8)"> 
              limits messages to 2^64 byes in length.
              The nonce length is 7 bytes allowing for 2^56 possible values of the nonce without repeating.
            </t>

            It is possible to do a pre-computation attack against the algorithm in cases where the portions encryption content is highly predictable.
            This reduces the security of the key size by half.
            Ways to deal with this attack include adding a random portion to the nonce value and/or increasing the key size used.
            Using a portion of the nonce for a random value will decrease the number of messages that a single key can be used for.
            Increasing the key size may require more resources in the constrained device.

    <section title="Key Derivation Functions (KDF)">
      <t>
        Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) are used to take some secret value and generate a different one.
        The original secret values come in three basic flavors:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Secrets which are uniformly random:  This is the type of secret which is created by a good random number generator.</t>
          <t>Secrets which are not uniformly random: This is type of secret which is created by operations like key agreement.</t>
          <t>Secrets which are not random: This is the type of secret that people generate for things like passwords.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        General KDF functions work well with the first type of secret, can do reasonable well with the second type of secret and generally do poorly with the last type of secret.
        None of the KDF functions in this section are designed to deal with the type of secrets that are used for passwords.
        Functions like PBSE2 <xref target="RFC2898"/> need to be used for that type of secret.
      </t>

      <t>
        Many functions are going to handle the first two type of secrets differently.
        The KDF function defined in <xref target="HKDF"/> can use different underlying constructions if the secret is uniformly random than if the secret is not uniformly random.
        This is reflected in the set of algorithms defined for HKDF.
      </t>

      <t>
        When using KDF functions, one component that is generally included is context information.
        Context information is used to allow for different keying information to be derived from the same secret.
        The use of context based keying material is considered to be a good security practice.

      <section title="HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF)" anchor="HKDF">
        <t> 
          The HKDF key derivation algorithm is defined in <xref target="RFC5869"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The HKDF algorithm is defined to take a number of inputs
          These inputs are:

          <list style="none">
            <t>
              secret - a shared value that is secret.
              Secrets may be either previously shared or derived from operations like a DH key agreement.
            </t>

            <t>
              salt - an optional public value that is used to change the generation process.
              If specified, the salt is carried using the 'salt' algorithm parameter.
              While <xref target="RFC5869"/> suggests that the length of the salt be the same as the length of the underlying hash value, any amount of salt will improve the security as different key values will be generated.
              A parameter to carry the salt is defined in <xref target="HKDF_Alg_Params"/>.
              This parameter is protected by being included in the key computation and does not need to be separately authenticated.
            </t>

            <t>
              length - the number of bytes of output that need to be generated.
            </t>

            <t>
              context information - Information that describes the context in which the resulting value will be used.
              Making this information specific to the context that the material is going to be used ensures that the resulting material will always be unique.
              The context structure used is encoded into the algorithm identifier.
            </t>

            <t>
              hash function - The underlying hash function to be used in the HKDF algorithm.
              The hash function is encoded into the HKDF algorithm selection.
            </t>

          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          HKDF is defined to use HMAC as the underlying PRF.
          However, it is possible to use other functions in the same construct to provide a different KDF function that may be more appropriate in the constrained world.
          Specifically, one can use AES-CBC-MAC as the PRF for the expand step, but not for the extract step.
          When using a good random shared secret of the correct length, the extract step can be skipped.
          The extract cannot be skipped if the secret is not uniformly random, for example if it is the result of a ECDH key agreement step.

      <section title="Context Information Structure" anchor="context">
        <t>
          The context information structure is used to ensure that the derived keying material is "bound" to the context of the transaction.
          The context information structure used here is based on that defined in <xref target="SP800-56A"/>.
          By using CBOR for the encoding of the context information structure, we automatically get the same type of type and length separation of fields that is obtained by the use of ASN.1.
          This means that there is no need to encode the lengths for the base elements as it is done by the JOSE encoding.
          <cref source="Ilari">
            Look to see if we need to be clearer about how the fields defined in the table are transported and thus why they have labels.
          </cref>
        </t>

        <t>
          The context information structure refers to PartyU and PartyV as the two parties which are doing the key derivation.
          Unless the application protocol defines differently, we assign PartyU to the entity that is creating the message and PartyV to the entity that is receiving the message.
          By doing this association, different keys will be derived for each direction as the context information is different in each direction.
        </t>

        <t>
          Application protocols are free to define the roles differently.
          For example, they could assign the PartyU role to the entity that initiates the connection and allow directly sending multiple messages over the connection in both directions without changing the role information.
        </t>

        <t>
          The use of a transaction identifier, either in one of the supplemental fields or as the salt if one is using HKDF, ensures that a unique key is generated for each set of transactions.
          Combining nonce fields with the transaction identifier provides a method so that a different key is used for each message in each direction.
        </t>

        <t>
          The context structure is built from information that is known to both entities.
          Some of the information is known only to the two entities, some is implied based on the application and some is explicitly transported as part of the message.
          The information that can be carried in the message, parameters have been defined and can be found in <xref target="KDF_Context_Alg_Params"/>.
          These parameters are designed to be placed in the unprotected bucket of the recipient structure.
          (They do not need to be in the protected bucket since they already are included in the cryptographic computation by virtue of being included in the context structure.)
        </t>

        <t>
          We encode the context specific information using a CBOR array type.
          The fields in the array are:

          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="AlgorithmID">
              This field indicates the algorithm for which the key material will be used.
              This field is required to be present and is a copy of the algorithm identifier in the message.
              The field exists in the context information so that if the same environment is used for different algorithms, then completely different keys will be generated each of those algorithms.
              (This practice means if algorithm A is broken and  thus can is easier to find, the key derived for algorithm B will not be the same as the key for algorithm B.)
            </t>

            <t hangText="PartyUInfo">
              This field holds information about party U.
              The PartyUInfo is encoded as a CBOR struture.
              The elements of PartyUInfo are encoded in the order presented, however if the element does not exist no element is placed in the array.
              The elements of the PartyUInfo array are:
              
              <list style="hanging">
                <t hangText="identity">
                  This contains the identity information for party U.
                  The identities can be assigned in one of two manners.
                  Firstly, a protocol can assign identities based on roles.
                  For example, the roles of "client" and "server" may be assigned to different entities in the protocol.
                  Each entity would then use the correct label for the data they they send or receive.
                  The second way is for a protocol to assign identities is to use a name based on a naming system (i.e. DNS, X.509 names).
                  <vspace/>
                  We define an algorithm parameter 'PartyU identity' that can be used to carry identity information in the message.
                  However, identity information is often known as part of the protocol and can thus be inferred rather than made explicit.
                  If identity information is carried in the message, applications SHOULD have a way of validating the supplied identity information.
                  The identity information does not need to be specified and can be left as absent.
                  <vspace/>
                  The identity value supplied will be integrity checked as part of the key derivation process.
                  If the identity string is wrong, then the wrong key will be created.
                </t>

                <t hangText="nonce">
                  This contains a one time nonce value.
                  The nonce can either be implicit from the protocol or carried as a value in the unprotected headers.
                  <vspace/>
                  We define an algorithm parameter 'PartyU nonce' that can be used to carry this value in the message
                  However, the nonce value could be determined by the application and the value determined from elsewhere.
                  <vspace/>

        Recipient algorithms can be defined into a number of different classes.
        COSE has the ability to support many classes of recipient algorithms.
        In this section, a number of classes are listed and then a set of algorithms are specified for each of the classes.
        The names of the recipient algorithm classes used here are the same as are defined in <xref target="RFC7517"/>.

            <section title="Security Considerations">
              <t>
                This recipient algorithm has several potential problems that need to be considered:
                <list style="symbols">
                  <t>
                    These keys need to have some method to be regularly updated over time.
                    All of the content encryption algorithms specified in this document have limits on how many times a key can be used without significant loss of security.
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    These keys need to be dedicated to a single algorithm.
                    There have been a number of attacks developed over time when a single key is used for multiple different algorithms.
                    One example of this is the use of a single key both for CBC encryption mode and CBC-MAC authentication mode.
                  </t>
                  <t>
                    Breaking one message means all messages are broken.
                    If an adversary succeeds in determining the key for a single message, then the key for all messages is also determined.

          <section title="Direct Key with KDF">
            <t>
              These recipient algorithms take a common shared secret between the two parties and applies the HKDF function (<xref target="HKDF"/>) using the context structure defined in <xref target="context"/> to transform the shared secret into the necessary key.
              Either the 'salt' parameter of HKDF or the partyU 'nonce' parameter of the context structure MUST be present.
              This parameter can be generated either randomly or deterministically, the requirement is that it be a unique value for the key pair in question.
            </t>

            <t>
              If the salt/nonce value is generated randomly, then it is suggested that the length of the random value be the same length as the hash function underlying HKDF.
              While there is no way to guarantee that it will be unique, there is a high probability that it will be unique.
              If the salt/nonce value is generated deterministically, it can be guaranteed to be unique and thus there is no length requirement.
            </t>

            <t>
              A new IV must be used if the same key is used in more than one message.
              The IV can be modified in a predictable manner, a random manner or an unpredictable manner.
              One unpredictable manner that can be used is to use the HKDF function to generate the IV.
              If HKDF is used for generating the IV, the algorithm identifier is set to "IV-GENERATION".

      <section title="Key Wrapping">
        <t>
          In key wrapping mode, the CEK is randomly generated and that key is then encrypted by a shared secret between the sender and the recipient.
          All of the currently defined key wrapping algorithms for JOSE (and thus for COSE) are AE algorithms.
          Key wrapping mode is considered to be superior to direct encryption if the system has any capability for doing random key generation.
          This is because the shared key is used to wrap random data rather than data  has some degree of organization and may in fact be repeating the same content.

            <t>
              The 'recipients' field is normally absent, but can be used.

            The AES Key Wrapping algorithm is defined in <xref target="RFC3394"/>.
            This algorithm uses an AES key to wrap a value that is a multiple of 64-bits, as such it can be used to wrap a key for any of the content encryption algorithms defined in this document.
            <!--  Don't care about this anymore
            <cref source="JLS">
              Do we also want to document the use of RFC 5649 as well?  
              It allows for other sizes of keys that might be used for HMAC - i.e. a 200 bit key.
              The algorithm exists, but I do not personally know of any standard uses of it.
              </cref>
              -->
            The algorithm requires a single fixed parameter, the initial value.
            This is fixed to the value specified in Section 2.2.3.1 of  <xref target="RFC3394"/>.
            There are no public parameters that vary on a per invocation basis.

            Keys may be obtained either from a key structure or from a recipient structure.
            If the key obtained from a key structure, the key type MUST be 'Symmetric'.
            Implementations creating and validating MAC values MUST validate that the key type, key length and algorithm are correct and appropriate for the entities involved.

              A key size of 2048 bits or larger MUST be used with these algorithms.

              It is highly recommended that checks on the key length  be done before starting a decryption operation.
              One potential denial of service operation is to provide encrypted objects using either abnormally long or oddly sized RSA modulus values.
              Implementations SHOULD be able to encrypt and decrypt with modulus between 2048 and 16K bits in length.
              Applications can impose additional restrictions on the length of the modulus.

      <section title="Direct Key Agreement">
        <t>
          The 'direct key agreement' class of recipient algorithms uses a key agreement method to create a shared secret.
          A KDF is then applied to the shared secret to derive a key to be used in protecting the data.
          This key is normally used as a CEK or MAC key, but could be used for other purposes if more than two layers are in use (see <xref target="three-layer"/>).
        </t>

        <t>
          The most commonly used key agreement algorithm used is Diffie-Hellman, but other variants exist.
          Since COSE is designed for a store and forward environment rather than an on-line environment, many of the DH variants cannot be used as the receiver of the message cannot provide any key material.
          One side-effect of this is that perfect forward security is not achievable, a static key will always be used for the receiver of the COSE message.
        </t>

        <t>
          Two variants of DH that are easily supported are:
          <list>
            <t>
-              Ephemeral-Static DH: where the sender of the message creates a one time DH key and uses a static key for the recipient.
              The use of the ephemeral sender key means that no additional random input is needed as this is randomly generated for each message.
            </t>

            <t>
              Static-Static DH: where a static key is used for both the sender and the recipient.
              The use of static keys allows for recipient to get a weak version of data origination for the message.
              When static-static key agreement is used, then some piece of unique data is require to ensure that a different key is created for each message
            </t>
          </list>
          
          In this specification, both variants are specified.
          This has been done to provide the weak data origination option for use with MAC operations.
        </t>

        <t>
          When direct key agreement mode is used, there MUST be only one recipient in the message.
          This method creates the key directly and that makes it difficult to mix with additional recipients.
          If multiple recipients are needed, then the version with key wrap needs to be used.
        </t>

        <t>
          The COSE_encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows:

            <t>
              At a minimum, the 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'alg' parameter and SHOULD contain a parameter identifying the recipient's asymmetric key.

                Curve Type/Curve: 
                The curve selected controls not only the size of the shared secret, but the mathematics for computing the shared secret.
                The curve selected also controls how a point in the curve is represented and what happens for the identity points on the curve.
                In this specification we allow for a number of different curves to be used.

              <t>
                Ephemeral-static or static-static:
                The key agreement process may be done using either a static or an ephemeral key at the senders side.
                When using ephemeral keys, the sender MUST generate a new ephemeral key for every key agreement operation.
                The ephemeral key is placed in in the 'ephemeral key' parameter and MUST be present for all algorithm identifiers which use ephemeral keys.
                When using static keys, the sender MUST either generate a new random value placed in either in the KDF parameters or the context structure.
                For the KDF functions used, this means either in the 'salt' parameter for HKDF (<xref target="HKDF_Alg_Params"/>) or in in the 'PartyU nonce' parameter for the context struture (<xref target="KDF_Context_Alg_Params"/>) MUST be present.
                (Both may be present if desired.)
                The value in the parameter MUST be unique for the key pair being used.
                It is acceptable to use a global counter which is incremented for every static-static operation and use the resulting value.
                When using static keys, the static key needs to be identified to the recipient.
                The static key can be identified either by providing the key ('static key') or by providing a key identifier for the static key ('static key id').
                Both of these parameters are defined in <xref target="table-ecdh-es-parameter-table"/>

              <t>
                Key derivation algorithm:
                The result of an ECDH key agreement process does not provide a uniformly random secret, as such it needs to be run through a KDF in order to produce a usable key.
                Processing the secret through a KDF also allows for the introduction of both context material, how the key is going to be used, and one time material in the even to of a static-static key agreement.
              </t>

              <t>
                Key Wrap algorithm:
                The key wrap algorithm can be 'none' if the result of the KDF is going to be used as the key directly.
                This option, along with static-static, should be used if knowledge about the sender is desired.
                If 'none' is used then the content layer encryption algorithm size is value fed to the context structure.
                Support is also provided for any of the key wrap algorithms defined in section <xref target="key_wrap_algs"/>.
                If one of these options is used, the input key size to the key wrap algorithm is the value fed into the context structure as the key size.

        The COSE_Key object defines a way to hold a single key object, it is still required that the members of individual key types be defined.
        This section of the document is where we define an initial set of members for specific key types.
      </t>

      <t>
        For each of the key types, we define both public and private members.
        The public members are what is transmitted to others for their usage.
        We define private members mainly for the purpose of archival of keys by individuals.
        However, there are some circumstances where private keys may be distributed by various entities in a protocol.
        Examples include:  Entities which have poor random number generation.
        Centralized key creation for multi-cast type operations.
        Protocols where a shared secret is used as a bearer token for authorization purposes.
      </t>

      <t>
        Key types are identified by the 'kty' member of the COSE_Key object.
        In this document we define four values for the member.

          Two different key structures are being defined for Elliptic Curve keys.
          One version uses both an x and a y coordinate, potentially with point compression.
          This is the traditional EC point representation that is used in <xref target="RFC5480"/>.
          
          The other version uses only the x coordinate as the y coordinate is either to be recomputed or not needed for the key agreement operation.

            The traditional way of sending EC curves has been to send either both the x and y coordinates, or the x coordinate and a sign bit for the y coordinate.
            The latter encoding has not been recommend in the IETF due to potential IPR issues with Certicom.
            However, for operations in constrained environments, the ability to shrink a message by not sending the y coordinate is potentially useful.

          This document defines a key structure for both the public and private halves of RSA keys.
          Together, an RSA public key and an RSA private key form an RSA key pair.
          <cref source="JLS">
            Looking at the CBOR specification, the bstr that we are looking in our table below should most likely be specified as big numbers rather than as binary strings.
            This means that we would use the tag 6.2 instead.
            From my reading of the specification, there is no difference in the encoded size of the resulting output.
            The specification of bignum does explicitly allow for integers encoded with leading zeros.

        <t>
          The document also provides support for the so-called "multi-prime" RSA where the modulus may have more than two prime factors.
          The benefit of multi-prime RSA is lower computational cost for the decryption and signature primitives.
          For a discussion on how multi-prime affects the security of RSA crypto-systems, the reader is referred to <xref target="MultiPrimeRSA"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          This document follows the naming convention of <xref target="RFC3447"/> for the naming of the fields of an RSA public or private key.
          The table <xref target="table-rsa-keys"/> provides a summary of the label values and the types associated with each of those labels.
          The requirements for fields for RSA keys are as follows:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              For all keys, 'kty' MUST be present and MUST have a value of 3.
            </t>
            <t>
              For public keys, the fields 'n' and 'e' MUST be present. 
              All other fields defined in <xref target="table-rsa-keys"/> MUST be absent.
            </t>
            <t>
              For private keys with two primes, the fields 'other', 'r_i', 'd_i' and 't_i' MUST be absent, all other fields MUST be present.
            </t>
            <t>
              For private keys with more than two primes, all fields MUST  be present. 
              For the third to nth primes, each of the primes is represented as a map containing the fields 'r_i', 'd_i' and 't_i'. 
              The field 'other' is an array of those maps.

          Occasionally it is required that a symmetric key be transported between entities.
          This key structure allows for that to happen.
        </t>

        <t>
          For symmetric keys, the 'kty' member is set to 3 (Symmetric).
          The member that is defined for this key type is:
          <list style="hanging">

              contains the value of the key.

        </t>

        <t>
          This key structure contains only private key information, care must be taken that it is never transmitted accidentally.
          For public keys, there are no required fields.
          For private keys, it is REQUIRED that 'k' be present in the structure.

      <t>
        There as been an attempt to limit the number of places where the document 
        needs to impose restrictions on how the CBOR Encoder needs to work.  We have
        managed to narrow it down to the following restrictions:
      </t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            The restriction applies to the encoding the Sig_structure, the Enc_structure, and the MAC_structure.
          </t>
          <t>
            The rules for Canonical CBOR (Section 3.9 of RFC 7049) MUST be used in these
            locations.  The main rule that needs to be enforced is that all lengths
            in these structures MUST be encoded such that they are encoded using definite lengths 
            and the minimum length encoding is used.
          </t>
          <t>
            All parsers used SHOULD fail on both parsing and generation if the same label is used twice as a key for the same map.

        I think this can go away because the text in the encryption section went away as well.
        
    <section anchor="AE-algo" title="AEAD and AE algorithms">

      <t>
        The set of encryption algorithms that can be used with this
        specification is restricted to authenticated encryption (AE) and
        authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) algorithms.
        This means that there is a strong check that the data decrypted by the
        recipient is the same as what was encrypted by the sender.
        Encryption modes such as counter have no check on this at all.
        The CBC encryption mode had a weak check that the data is correct,
        given a random key and random data, the CBC padding check will pass
        one out of 256 times.
        There have been several times that a normal encryption mode has been
        combined with an integrity check to provide a content encryption mode
        that does provide the necessary authentication.
        AES-GCM <xref target="AES-GCM"/>, AES-CCM <xref target="RFC3610"/>, AES-CBC-HMAC
        <xref target="I-D.mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2"/> are  examples of these composite
        modes.
      </t>

      <t>
        PKCS v1.5 RSA key transport does not qualify as an AE algorithm.
        There are only three bytes in the encoding that can be checked as
        having decrypted correctly, the rest of the content can only be
        probabilistically checked as having decrypted correctly.
        For this reason, PKCS v1.5 RSA key transport MUST NOT be used with
        this specification.
        RSA-OAEP was designed to have the necessary checks that that content
        correctly decrypted and does qualify as an AE algorithm.
      </t>

      <t>
        When dealing with authenticated encryption algorithms, there is always some type of value that needs to be checked to see if the authentication level has passed.
        This authentication value may be:
      </t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            A separately generated tag computed by both the encrypter and decrypter and then compared by the decryptor.
            This tag value may be either placed at the end of the cipher text (the decision we made) or kept separately (the decision made by the JOSE working group).
            This is the approach followed by AES-GCM <xref target="AES-GCM"/> and AES-CCM <xref target="RFC3610"/>.
            <! - - Mike Jones:  Last sentence is not clear.  He is reading this as referring to ? rather than just being generating a tag. - M00TODO - - >
          </t>
          <t>
            A fixed value that is part of the encoded plain text.
            This is the approach followed by the AES key wrap algorithm <xref target="RFC3394"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            A computed value is included as part of the encoded plain text.
            The computed value is then checked by the decryptor using the same computation path.
            This is the approach followed by RSAES-OAEP <xref target="RFC3447"/>.

    <section anchor="Grammar_Appendix" title="CDDL Grammar">

      <t>
        For people who prefer using a formal language to describe the syntax of the CBOR, in this section a CDDL grammar is given that corresponds to <xref target="I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl"/>.
        This grammar is informational, in the event of differences between this grammar and the prose, the prose is considered to be authorative.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The collected CDDL can be extracted from the XML version of this document via the following XPath expression below.

    <section anchor="three-layer" title="Three Levels of Recipient Information">

      <t>
        All of the currently defined recipient algorithms classes only use two levels of the COSE_Encrypt structure.
        The first level is the message content and the second level is the content key encryption.
        However, if one uses a recipient algorithm such as RSA-KEM (see Appendix A of RSA-KEM <xref target="RFC5990"/>, then it make sense to have three levels of the COSE_Encrypt structure.
      </t>

      <t>
        These levels would be:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Level 0: The content encryption level.  This level contains the payload of the message.
          </t>
          <t>
            Level 1: The encryption of the CEK by a KEK.
          </t>
          <t>
            Level 2: The encryption of a long random secret using an RSA key and a key derivation function to convert that secret into the KEK.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        This is an example of what a triple layer message would look like.
        The message has the following layers:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Level 0: Has a content encrypted with AES-GCM using a 128-bit key.
          </t>
          <t>
            Level 1: Uses the AES Key wrap algorithm with a 128-bit key.
          </t>
          <t>
            Level 2: Uses ECDH Ephemeral-Static direct to generate the level 1 key.
          </t>
        </list>

        In effect this example is a decomposed version of using the ECDH-ES+A128KW algorithm.

        The examples can be found at https://github.com/cose-wg/Examples.  The file names in each section correspond the the same file names in the repository. I am currently still in the process of getting the examples up there along with some control information for people to be able to check and reproduce the examples.

      <t>
        To make it easier to read, the examples are presented using the CBOR's diagnostic notation rather than a binary dump.
        A ruby based tool exists to convert between a number of formats.
        This tool can be installed with the command line:
